# DarkShield-Web-Page

## Summary
This repository demonstrates an example of using web pages to interact with the DarkShield API for searching and masking of data in text or files.

This example offers an interface for sending requests to a running DarkShield API instance to set up contexts (which define ways to classify data
using search matchers, and pair each classification with a masking rule), upload files for search and masking, and upload the JSON-formatted masking results
that are returned as a part of the response of a masking request from the DarkShield API for easier analysis in a table view.
